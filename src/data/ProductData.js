// We use the number property for two reasons:
// 1) in each object because the React documentation
// recommends against using the same id to map over an object as well as using it
// for other things.
// 2) Each cart item has it's own child route, and an ID is needed to display each
// child route. Because we already have an ID when mapping over the watchObjects, it is
// called number here instead
