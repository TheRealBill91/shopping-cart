# Shopping Cart

## About

This project is a shopping cart application built with React. The purpose of this project is to practice using React, react-router-dom, Unit & UI testing, as well as other skills learned in The Odin Project curriculum. The application has at least two routes and allows users to navigate between pages with a navigation bar.

## Features

- Two pages: a homepage and a shop page, which includes the shopping cart
- Navigation bar to navigate between pages
- Sticky bar on the shopping cart route that displays the number of items currently in the cart
- Button to go to the cart for checkout and payment
- Individual card items for each product with an input field for quantity, increment and decrement buttons, a title, and an “Add To Cart” button
- Cart updates when a user submits their order
